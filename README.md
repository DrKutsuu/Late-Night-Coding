# Late-Night-Coding

This is my repo for mini projects and challenges, this contains:
1. [miniprojects](./miniprojects/) These are my smaller scale projects, these can either be; miniprojects which are small enough in scope or random enough to not be included in their own repo, or protoypes for larger projects that I want to work out before moving to their own custom repo
2. [challenges](./challenges/) These are random code challenges in various states of completion
